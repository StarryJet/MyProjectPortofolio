                <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
                <p>Pusat Kesihatan Universiti (PKU) UTM was established in 1972 to provide medical care and health facilities to ensure the universityâ€™s community (students and staffs) health and well-being. During this time, the unit was managed by four medical doctors, a dentist and several other support staff and assisted by a trained clinical staff.</p>
                <p>Beginning from September 1993, PKU UTM was officially recognized as a panel clinic for the UTM employees. Under this regulation, all UTM employees can have access to the PKU health and medical services. In addition, PKU UTM also provides facilities to perform services outside of the community such as students, workers and visitors, to private universities.</p>
